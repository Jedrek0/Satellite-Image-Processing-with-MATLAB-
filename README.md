MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) integrates computation, visualization, and programming in
an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar
mathematical notation. MATLAB features a family of application-specific solutions called
toolboxes. Toolboxes are comprehensive collections of MATLAB functions (M-files) that
extend the MATLAB environment to solve particular classes of problems. Areas in which
toolboxes are available include signal processing, control systems, neural networks, fuzzy
logic, wavelets, simulation, image processing and many others. Image processing tool box
has extensive functions for many operations for image restoration, enhancement and
information extraction. Some of the basic features of the image processing tool box are
explained and demonstrated with the help of a satellite imagery obtained from IRS (Indian
Remote Sensing Satellite) LISS III data of Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka.
